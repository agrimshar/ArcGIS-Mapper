The ArcGIS UofT Toronto Mapper Project (ECE297) is a software project developed as part of a course in Engineering at the University of Toronto. The goal is to design and implement a Geographic Information System (GIS) for the city of Toronto. This system processes real-world map data, enabling users to visualize the city’s infrastructure, search for specific locations, and calculate routes between different points.

The code is copyrighted by the University of Toronto, so it can't be shared publicly. If you are interested, please let me know and I'd be happy to share it with you.

Key features of the project include:
- Efficient data parsing of Toronto's road networks, intersections, and points of interest.
- Implementation of pathfinding algorithms, such as Dijkstra’s and A* (A-star), to compute the shortest paths.
- Visualization of map data using a GUI or interactive console interface.
- Optimized memory and time performance, accommodating large datasets and real-time user interactions.

This project demonstrates skills in software engineering, algorithm design, data structures, and real-world application of geographic data systems.
